        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p class="job-title">Engineering Lead - <a href="https://www.catalyticconsulting.net" target="_blank">Catalytic Consulting Inc</a> (April 2024 - Present)</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as the Engineering Lead at Catalytic Consulting, a water consulting firm, where I'm leading innovative product design efforts for PFAS filtration and destruction removing forever chemicals from America's Water Supply, while incorporating design for manufacturability, assembly, supply chain, and servicability. In some of our past projects, I've optimized cycle test stand performance for an EDI ultrapure water filtration system, enhancing reliability and reducing operational costs by over $1 million in under six months. I've revamped documentation workflows, creating customer-centric materials that increased sales by $2 million.</p>
        
        <h2>Past Work/Education</h2>
        <p class="job-title">Test Developer - <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/waste/packaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Fulfilment Technologies and Robotics</a> (May 2024 - October 2024) <i> Contract</i></p>
        <p>At Amazon's MSP group, I led a team of Test Engineeers to verify and qualify an advanced rigid packaging automation machine from an existing vendor. My primary task was to deliver a comprehensive test report that helped the MSP group's leadership and Product Management Team. The project significantly improved the machine's Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) from 65% to over 95%. This $3 million project successfully reduced the time-to-market by three years by identifying and qualifying an off the shelf solution.</p>
        
        <p class="job-title">Test Engineer - <a href="https://www.sparkcharge.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SparkCharge Inc</a> (April 2023 - December 2023)</p>
        <p>SparkCharge built mobile EV fast charging solutions, focusing on DC-DC Level 3 chargers. As a test engineer, I designed an end-of-line charger test stand that streamlined integration testing, accelerating project timelines by 30% and achieving substantial long-term cost savings. Additionally, I developed a highly reliable service tool to address field deployment issues with the V1 and V2 core products of the company, boosting customer retention by up to 80%. My contributions also included designing for serviceability and refining requirements to enhance the V3 product line, ensuring more robust and maintainable systems.</p>
        
        <p class="job-title">Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - <a href="https://mae.ufl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Florida</a> (2020 - 2022)</p>
        <p>Between 2020 and 2022, I pursued a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida, During which I was part of the Engineering Innovation Institute, where I took coursework in engineering innovation and divergent thinking. I learned the art of asking the right questions and developed skills in empathetic design. As part of the "Innovation for Defense" course, I led a team of five students in collaboration with NIWC Atlantic, DoD and the U.S. Navy, developing innovative radio direction-finding solutions to help C-130 pilots identify ground-based threats across a very wide range of frequency spectrum.</p>
        
        <p class="job-title">Development Test Engineer - <a href="https://www.agnikul.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agnikul Cosmos</a> (January 2019 - August 2019)</p>
        <p>Agnikul Cosmos, founded in 2017, aimed to build a launch vehicle capable of carrying 100 kg payloads to Low Earth Orbit. As the first test engineer of the company, I designed and developed a portable semi-cryogenic liquid propulsion test stand, qualifying engines up to 25 kN. This stand provided critical characterization data that helped the propulsion team validate and refine designs, contributing directly to securing a $3.2 million seed funding round.</p>
        
        <p class="job-title">Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering - <a href="https://www.annauniv.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna University</a> (2014 - 2018)</p>
        <p>From 2014 to 2018, I pursued a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Anna University. During this time, I actively engaged with the maker space community in Chennai, gaining hands-on experience with 3D printers and robots through a few different internships. I spent three years building FDM printers and learning how to develop hardware. Outside of my coursework, I independently studied launch vehicles and interplanetary robotics as a personal passion, which ultimately led to my first full-time job at Agnikul Cosmos.</p>
